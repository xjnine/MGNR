# MNGR
A Multi-Granularity Neighbor Relationship and Its Application in KNN Classification and Clustering Methods
## MGKNN
Improve the KNN method by combining the granular-ball model and neighbor relationship to achieve adaptive estimation of the $k$ value.
### Files
These program mainly containing:
  - a  real dataset folder named "datasets".
  - a python file named “main.py” is the main function file.
  - other python files
### Requirements
#### Installation requirements (Python 3.8)
  - Pycharm 
  - Linux operating system or Windows operating system

  The real dataset should be given in a csv file of the following format:
  - In every line, there are d+1 numbers: the label of the point and the d coordinate values, where the label is an integer from 0 to n-1.
### Usage
  Run the main.py to test the code on the dataset and evaluate the classification results using ACC scores.
